# Aug10 - Initial Silvina Investigation

This folder contains the consolidated results from the initial investigation into Silvina's "First Strike" targeting algorithm.

## Files

1. **01_ANALYSIS_AND_DISCOVERY.md** - Complete analysis of the investigation process, pattern discovery, and the diagonal zone theory that led to 95% accuracy.

2. **02_TEST_DATA.md** - All test results and data from the investigation, including controlled ties, three-way ties, adjacent enemies, and cross-arena testing.

## Key Discovery

The investigation revealed that Silvina's tie-breaking behavior when enemies are equidistant follows a diagonal zone pattern based on the symmetrical tile's position relative to a diagonal line through tiles 4, 9, 16, 23, 30, 37, 42.

## Results
- **Initial simple rule**: 77% accuracy
- **Diagonal zone theory**: 95% accuracy
- **Evolution to DIAGONAL_ROWS** (Aug11): 89.5% accuracy with cleaner code

This work evolved into the DIAGONAL_ROWS pattern discovery in Aug11, which achieved 89.5% accuracy with cleaner, more maintainable code.
