# Aug11 - DIAGONAL_ROWS Pattern Discovery

This folder documents the breakthrough discovery of the DIAGONAL_ROWS pattern for Silvina's targeting algorithm, evolving from Aug10's hardcoded tile lists to an elegant position-based solution.

## Files

1. **01_DISCOVERY_JOURNEY.md** - The complete investigation narrative showing how we discovered the DIAGONAL_ROWS pattern, including failed hypotheses, user corrections, and the final breakthrough.

2. **02_IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS.md** - Technical documentation of the final implementation, including code examples, pattern rules, testing infrastructure, and performance metrics.

3. **03_TEST_RESULTS.md** - Comprehensive test results showing the performance of the DIAGONAL_ROWS implementation across all test cases, with detailed breakdowns by test file.

## Key Achievement

Discovered that Silvina's tie-breaking behavior follows a simple rule based on tile position within DIAGONAL_ROWS:
- **First position in row** → Prefer LOWER hex ID
- **Last position in row** → Prefer HIGHER hex ID  
- **Middle positions** → Context-dependent (generally LOWER)

## Results

- **Pattern-based implementation**: 89.5% accuracy (128/143 tests)
- **Code reduction**: From ~20 lines of hardcoded lists to ~10 lines of logic
- **Maintainability**: Clear, documented pattern instead of arbitrary tile lists
- **Elegance**: Rotational symmetry handled with simple preference inversion

## Context for Future Reference

This investigation demonstrates the value of:
1. Challenging initial assumptions (our grid mental model was wrong)
2. User feedback (corrections led to breakthroughs)
3. Preferring patterns over hardcoding (even with slight accuracy trade-off)
4. Comprehensive testing (143 test cases revealed edge cases)
5. Documenting the journey (understanding "why" is as important as "what")
