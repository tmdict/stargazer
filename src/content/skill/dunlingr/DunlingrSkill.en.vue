      <h1>Dunlingr</h1>

      <h2>Ultimate Negation</h2>

      <h3>Ultimate</h3>
      <p>
        Dunlingr designates the Bell of Order as either Spellbind or Curelock before a battle
        starts, setting the stage for the battle's order.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spellbind: Unable to cast Ultimate.</li>
        <li>Curelock: Unable to recover HP for others.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Passive.</strong> Dunlingr summons the Bell of Order when a battle starts and keeps
        it on the battlefield for [[12]]s.
      </p>

      <h2>Targeting Mechanics</h2>

      <h3>EX Skill</h3>
      <p>
        Dunlingr protects the farthest non-summoned ally, ensuring they are not affected by his
        order until the ally is defeated.
      </p>

      <h3>How It Works</h3>

      <p>
        Dunlingr automatically identifies and targets a character on his own team that is furthest
        away from his current tile.
      </p>
      <p>
        Distance calculation uses hexagonal grid distance to determine the furthest teammate.
        Dunlingr cannot target himself.
      </p>
      <p>When multiple teammates have the same distance:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ally Team Dunlingr:</strong> Prefers the ally with the lower hex ID</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enemy Team Dunlingr:</strong> Prefers the teammate with the higher hex ID (180°
          rotation)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Non-Permanent Buff</h2>

      <h3>Enhance Force</h3>
      <p>
        Upon casting Echo of Silence, Dunlingr grants all allies [[50]] ATK SPD for [[6]]s if the
        order is set to Spellbind, or provides them with [[25]] Life Drain for [[6]]s if the order
        is set to Curelock.
